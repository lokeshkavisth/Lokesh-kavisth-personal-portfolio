        Designing the website was a long trip and unfortunately we still have
        some steps to take. The old version of the website is still the
        primary one and that means we need to work more to make it public. The
        optimistic plan assumes publication of the new website before the end
        of the current month, because we need to show it to the head, the
        community and then switch it. If everything goes well, in August we
        will see a fresh, new website alive!
      </p>
      <p>
        What complicated the situation even further is the fact that the
        community is quite big, and they want to be open, fair and welcoming
        to everybody. They take under consideration opinions from hundreds of
        people. But designing a website is not only trusting our tastes and
        what people think is nice and what is not. It’s also a good taste of a
        designer, but mostly adopting trends, the newest practices and
        everything that makes a website more customer friendly and easy to
        navigate.

      We can officially announce that the new OpenMRS website is being
      released. Fortunately, its transfer was faster and easier than the beta,
      and we could watch a beautifully presented new website after just one
      weekend.
